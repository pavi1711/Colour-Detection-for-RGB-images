# Colour-Detection-for-RGB-images
"we are going to build an  application through which you can automatically get the name of the  color by clicking on them.\n\n

The project folder contains 3 files:\n
  1.Color_detection.py – main source code of our project.\m
  2.Colorpic.jpg – sample image for experimenting.\n
  3.Colors.csv – a file that contains our dataset."
